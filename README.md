## Project Description
This project is a web page for a fictional restaurant that is nearly entirely dynamically created through vanilla javascript DOM manipulation. The Home, Menu, and About pages each have their own ES6 module that adds the page content to the DOM. The buttons on the navbar are attached to an event listener that calls a function which clears the DOM and determines which module to run.

This project was mainly an exercise in using webpack. This is the first time I've used webpack. After following the tutorial and getting the initial setup done it wasn't too complicated. The most useful part of webpack for me was webpack-dev-server. It essentially functions like the LiveServer extension for VSCode. As I begin to use more modules in larger projects I'm sure that webpack will be a very valuable tool for managing dependencies.
